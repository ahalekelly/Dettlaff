# Dettlaff Project Knowledge

## Project Overview
- Dettlaff is a modular controller system for brushless flywheel Nerf blasters
- The project includes hardware designs and software for controlling and monitoring the blaster

## Key Components
- dyno: A Python script for plotting dynamometer data
- src: Contains the main source code for the controller
- hardware: Contains hardware designs and documentation

## Development Environment
- Uses PlatformIO for embedded development
- Python virtual environment for dyno script

## Flashing Instructions
- Firmware can be flashed over USB or WiFi
- Requires VSCode with PlatformIO extension

## Wiring
- Specific wiring instructions are provided in the README
- Caution is needed when connecting ESCs to avoid damage

## TODO
- Add more detailed information about the src and hardware components as they are explored
